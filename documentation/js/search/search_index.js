The async operation is not required and exists due to legacy angular implementation of dynamic components.\nmodal.open() now returns the DialogRef instance and NOT the Promise.\n\nYou need to refactor your codebase to accomodate this change, this is a big change\nand it is required to remove the complexity working with DialogRef.\nPlugin authoers: Maybe type does not exists anymore.\nIf you retuned the dialog instance from your Modal implementations there is not much to refactor other then types here and there.\nIf you return Promise of DialogRef you will have to refactor your code.\n\n4.0.0-beta.0 (2017-08-13)\nCode Refactoring\n\nsupport angular version 5 (#382) (e628875)\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\nAngular version 5 comes with a breaking change which results in an internal breaking change which remove API options\n\nBindings are no longer supported when opening a modal.\nProviding bindings was, from day one, a shortcut to a manual operation.\nIf you used bindings before, instead provide an injector with the bindings inside.\nMost of the users should not feel this change as usage of bindings should be minimal.\nIf you wrote a plugin you should feel this, follow the change set for one\nof the native plugins as an conversion example.\n\n3.0.2 (2017-08-11)\nFeatures\n\nbootstrap: support bootstrap 4 (23cb2a0), closes #280\n\n\n3.0.1 (2017-06-21)\nBug Fixes\n\nlazy loading issue (f9f6d2e), closes #366\n\n\n3.0.0 (2017-06-20)\nBug Fixes\n\nhandle document for angular universal (2f98e75)\nrefactor: use ng-template instead of template\nrefactor: remove defaultOverlayTarget directive\nbuild: revamp the build process, use FESM and flat compiler metadata for faster, smaller bundles.\nrefactor: replace custom  with ngComponentOutlet\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\nMoving to use  will break applications running on \nApplications using defaultOverlayTarget (all of them) will have to omit it\n\n\n2.0.2 (2016-11-08)\nBug Fixes\n\nnon ESM module bundlers (webpack1) can't load plugins (ef35c80), closes #244\n\n\n2.0.1 (2016-10-06)\nBug Fixes\n\ndo not include node reference in package output (5dfc9aa), closes #213\nbootstrap: set proper types for size and dialogClass in BSModalContextBuilder (955b02b), closes #205\n\n\n2.0.0-beta.14 (2016-10-03)\nBug Fixes\n\nsuppress unhandled rejection (a383762), closes #188\n\nCode Refactoring\n\nbuild: refactor to support AoT (9db8f5e), closes #206 #207 #204\n\nFeatures\n\nsupport setting an injector when creating a modal (overlay). injector is optional. (c0a9b71)\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\nbuild: NPM Package now comes with ES6 Module version (ESM) and an ES5 UMD bundle (1 file), this should'nt have any effect. (CJS version removed)\nES6 version contains d.ts files as well as metadata.json files for AoT Compilation.\n\nThis breaking change mainly effect the development process of angular2-modal.\nTo support AoT a complete restructiing of the NPM package and build process was needed. Some devDependencies removed and some changed.\nDevelopment process is now managed by Webpack 2.\nIt is recommended to delete the node_modules directory and npm install again.\n\n2.0.0-beta.13 (2016-09-17)\n\n2.0.0-beta.12 (2016-09-01)\nBug Fixes\n\nbootstrap: removed the dependency of the FormModule in the prompt modal (07fcce8)\nremove Renderer use in the Modal service, create projetables in the overlay component (71a5c2c), closes #174 #175\n\nFeatures\n\nbootstrap: Added proper prompt support in bootstrap. closes #https://github.com/shlomiassaf/angular2-modal/issues/119 (329f987)\n\n\n2.0.0-beta.11 (2016-08-30)\nFeatures\n\nDefaultOverlayTarget: directive to the the default view container, can be used instead of the manual way which has some boilerplate (8d0c932)\nSwapComponent: a directive that creates a dynamic component inside a template (bd8182e)\nadd overlayConfigFactory, a factory/helper to make it easy to open custom modals using the open() method (852fd17)\nallow registering dynamic components (250f234)\nbuilders inheriting from OverlayContextBuilder return an OverlayConfig, simple and quick way to open modals (d115100)\nsupport for TemplateRef and literal string as modal content (2e6f6a0)\nsupport stacks of a specific group (i.e: overlay stack per plugin) (18acd51)\nTemplateRef can access the dialog so it can control the modal and access the context (5e6c59e)\nVEX: support ContainerContent (cb1f779)\n\nBug Fixes\n\ncss dialog container should not bind to class and style (e8196e8)\noverlay component should hide overflow when inside element (cf432b3)\nwrong banner in build (2c9bca5)\nbootstrap: backdrop position should be absolute when inside element (33201ae)\nbootstrap: undeclared component in module (76a7c08), closes #168\nVEX: normalize context (97adecd)\n\nCode Refactoring\n\nCSSDialogContainer support for ContainerContent (support string, TepmlateRef and Components as content) (975afea)\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\nuntil now a modal can only open a component, this change allows a modal to open A ContainerContent which is a type the can be string, TemplateRef or a component (Type). To support this feature some partially breaking changes were made in the Modal class\nFor developers using the library the modal.open(componentType: any, config?: OverlayConfig), the 1st parameter is now called content and it's type is  ContainerContent: modal.open(content: ContainerContent, config?: OverlayConfig).\nFor developers building plugins the same rule apply on the 2nd parameter of thecreate method.\nAlso, the createModal method is deprecated, plugins should now use the createBackdrop and createContainer methods.\nEach container component supplied to createContainer must express  in it's template so the content (string, templateRef, component) can be injected into it.\nmethod CSSDialogContainer.addComponent() was removed since modal containers are based on ng-content. Also removed the bindings for tabindex and role, they are now static\n\n\n2.0.0-beta.10 (2016-08-23)\nCode Refactoring\n\nimplement overlay stack per plugin for vex & bootstrap (2c9bca5)\nmove dynamic CSS/Style component to use direct element update (via renderer) instead of binding.

dynamic styling via CSS classes and inline styles.\n2 - Easy wrapper for interception of transition/animation end events.\n3 - Easy wrapper for component creation and injection.\nDynamic css is done via direct element manipulation (via renderer), it does not use change detection\nor binding. This is to allow better control over animation.\nAnimation support is limited, only transition/keyframes END even are notified.\nThe animation support is needed since currently the angular animation module is limited as well and\ndoes not support CSS animation that are not pre-parsed and are not in the styles metadata of a component.\nCapabilities: Add/Remove styls, Add/Remove classes, listen to animation/transition end event,\nadd components\n\n            \n\n\n            \n                Implements\n            \n            \n                        OnDestroy\n            \n\n

   \n            \n                Represent an object where every property is a function representing an assignment function.\nCalling each function with a value will assign the value to the object and return the object.\nCalling 'toJSON' returns an object with the same properties but this time representing the\nassigned values.\nThis allows setting an object in a fluent API manner.\nExample:\nlet fluent = new FluentAssign(undefined, ['some', 'went']);\nfluent.some('thing').went('wrong').toJSON();\n// { some: 'thing', went: 'wrong' }\n\n            \n\n\n\n            \n
